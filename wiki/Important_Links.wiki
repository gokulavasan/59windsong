== Important terms ==
  # Activities: The building block of the user interface is the activity. You can think of an activity as being the Android analogue for the window for dialog box in a desktop application. 
  # Content providers: Content providers provide a level of abstraction for any data stored on the device that is accessible by multiple
applications. 
  # Services: Activities and content providers are short-lived and can be shut down at any time. Services, on the other hand, are designed to
keep running, if needed, independent of any activity. You might use a
service for checking for updates to an RSS feed or to play back music
even if the controlling activity is no longer operating.
  # Intents: Intents are system messages, running around the inside of the device, notifying applications of various events, from hardware state changes (e.g., an SD card was inserted), to incoming data (e.g., anSMS message arrived), to application events (e.g., your activity was
launched from the deviceâ€™s main menu). Not only can you respond to
intents, but you can create your own to launch other activities or to let you know when specific situations arise (e.g., raise such-and-so intent when the user gets within 100 meters of this-and-such location).
